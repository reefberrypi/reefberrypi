<h1>ReefberryPi</h1>

ReefberryPi is a Django application that enables you to control your reef aquarium through a website
interface and running on a RaspberryPi. Currently the code is in development (not even ALPHA) and has almost no features
apart from setting light intensity through the standard Django admin interface. The application depends on the Adafruit 16-channel
PWM controller being connected to the Rpi.
